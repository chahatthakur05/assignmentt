        "Decision Tree Basics\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It's a tree-like model where each node represents a feature, and each branch represents a decision based on that feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it Works for Classification\n",
        "1. Root Node: The top node, representing the entire dataset.\n",
        "2. Splitting: Data is split based on feature values (e.g., age > 30).\n",
        "3. Decision Nodes: Internal nodes that split data further.\n",
        "4. Leaf Nodes: Terminal nodes predicting class labels.\n",
        "5. Prediction: New data traverses the tree, following decisions to a leaf node.\n",

        "#2. Explain the concepts of Gini Impurity and Entropy as impurity measures.\n",
        "Impurity Measures in Decision Trees\n",

        "Gini Impurity\n",
        "- Formula: G = 1 - Σ(p_i²) where p_i is class i's proportion.\n",
        "- Interpretation: Probability of incorrect classification if randomly labeled.\n",
        "- Range: 0 (pure) to 0.5 (max impurity for binary).\n",

        "Entropy\n",
        "- Formula: H = -Σ(p_i * log₂(p_i))\n",

        "- Range: 0 (pure) to 1 (max impurity for binary).\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact on Splits\n",
        "- Goal: Minimize impurity (maximize purity).\n",
        "- Split selection: Choose feature/split maximizing Information Gain:\n",
        "    - Gini: ΔG = G_parent - (n_left/n * G_left + n_right/n * G_right)\n",
        "    - Entropy: IG = H_parent - weighted H_children\n",
        "- Both lead to similar trees; Gini is faster, Entropy can lead to more balanced splits.\n",

        "- When: During tree growth.\n",
        "- How: Stop splitting based on criteria (e.g., max depth, min samples).\n",

Furthermore the goal of the\nresearch that led to the creation of this dataset was to study the\nimpact of air quality but it did not give adequate demonstration of the\nvalidity of this assumption.\n\nThe scikit-learn maintainers therefore strongly discourage the use of\nthis dataset unless the purpose of the code is to study and educate\nabout ethical issues in data science and machine learning.\n\nIn this special case, you can fetch the dataset from the original\nsource::\n\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n\n    data_url = \"http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston\"\n    raw_df = pd.read_csv(data_url, sep=\"\\s+\", skiprows=22, header=None)\n    data = np.hstack([raw_df.values[::2, :], raw_df.values[1::2, :2]])\n    target = raw_df.values[1::2, 2]\n\nAlternative datasets include the California housing dataset and the\nAmes housing dataset. You can load the datasets as follows::\n\n    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\n    housing = fetch_california_housing()\n\nfor the California housing dataset and::\n\n    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml\n    housing = fetch_openml(name=\"house_prices\", as_frame=True)\n\nfor the Ames housing dataset.\n\n[1] M Carlisle.\n\"Racist data destruction?\"\n<https://medium.com/@docintangible/racist-data-destruction-113e3eff54a8>\n\n[2] Harrison Jr, David, and Daniel L.
